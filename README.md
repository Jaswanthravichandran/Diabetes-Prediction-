# Diabetes-Prediction
## Introduction
In this project, our objective is to predict whether the patient has diabetes or not based on various features like Glucose level, Insulin, Age, BMI. We will perform all the steps from Data gathering to Model deployment. During Model evaluation, we compare various machine learning algorithms on the basis of accuracy_score metric and find the best one.

## Pre-Requisites
If you have Jupyter in your requirements.txt and you activate that environment (I recommend Virtualenv), install, and run Jupyter, you'll have all the specific versions you want. So:

- python3 -m venv venv

- source venv/bin/activate (Windows: venv\Scripts\activate)

- pip install -r requirements.txt

- jupyter lab (or jupyter notebook)

## Installation
- Clone this repository and unzip it.
  
- Open the .ipynb file in visual studio code

- Run the Notebook and check the results
